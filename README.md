# Unity Buoyancy Physics 

This is a fork of the code published by Erik Nordeus on creating a realistic floating object in Unity with simplified physics equations. Erik's main inspiration comes from these articles, written by Jacques Kerner, a senior software engineer at Avalanche Studios. The work put into Just Cause 3's boat physics are elaborated below:

* [Water interaction model for boats in video games: Part 2](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/water-interaction-model-for-boats-in-video-games-part-2)

The grandfather-discussion can be tracked to the work of Edouard Halbert in 2012, which features SimShip, written in C# 3.8 in VS 2008. The codes by Edouard featured the triangle-triangle intersection routines as presented by P. Guigue - O. Devillers "Fast and Robust Triangle-Triangle Overlap Test Using Orientation Predicates", 2003
