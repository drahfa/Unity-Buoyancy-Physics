# Unity Buoyancy Physics 

This is a fork of the code published by Erik Nordeus on creating a realistic floating object in Unity with simplified physics equations. Erik's main inspiration comes from these articles, written by Jacques Kerner, a senior software engineer at Avalanche Studios. The work put into Just Cause 3's boat physics are elaborated below:
